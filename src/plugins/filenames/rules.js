   * convention policies.
   *
   * ie: null, kebab, snake, camel, pascal
   *
   * If you prefer to use suffixes for files, use a second transformation
   * parameter to allow us to remove parts of a filename (matching a regex
   * pattern) before transforming and matching against the export.

   *     export default function variableName

   *     1. variableName.react.js
   *     2. variableName.js
   *     3. variableName/index.js
   *
   * If you also want to match func calls, you can use the third option:  a
   * boolean flag.
   *
   * ie: ["error", null, null, true]
   *
   *     export default functionName()
   *
   *     Would only be considered a problem if file isn't named:
   *     1. functionName.js
   *     2. function-name/index.js
